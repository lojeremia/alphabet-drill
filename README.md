### Description
The purpose of my website is to showcase an old poem I wrote in a visual and interactive way (I apologize in advance for subjecting y'all to my high school poetry haha), as well as to motivate people to take action against gun violence. Ideally, this would be one part of a larger interactive writing portfolio site. The information conveyed is the body of the poem, which slowly reveals itself as the user hovers over the alphabet. I hoped to add to interest and engagement via the animations on the alphabet and poem lines. The target audience is anyone who might be interested in reading the text. 

### Using the Website
Hover over the alphabet to display the poem, starting with "A". Once you have revealed the entire poem, there will be an option to reset the page on the bottom left. To see the history behind the poem, click on the learn more button. 

### External Libraries
I used Animate.css and jQuery. Animate.css was utilized so I could quickly apply animation to the instructional text at the beginning. I added this to draw the user's attention to the instructions on the right hand side of the screen. I chose to use jQuery to easily show and hide the poem lines when the user hovered over the letters, as well as style the first word of each line in the color associated with its respective color. This allows the user to slowly reveal the poem as they interact with the alphbaet. 

### Iteration from HW8
A high-level overview of what I changed from HW8 is
(1) Making the instructions and purpose of the website clearer.
(2) Adjusting the learn more, gun cursor, and reset button to reduce confusion and align with the visual style of the site. 
(3) Adding more visual affordance by locking the poem so that readers can view the poem in alphabetical order, instead of revealing lines of text at random. 

### Major Challenges
The main challenge in assignment 9 was figuring out how to progressively light up the next letter that the user could hover over as they went through the poem, as well as preventing animations from happening when people hovered over the alphabet haphazardly. 

### Next Steps 
1. Make gun cursor change color on links to give more feedback that you can click them. 
2. Integrate this as a part of a larger writing website.
